"""
AWSOM* is a collection of automation tools originally developed by Peter Fison
(https://github.com/PFython) for use at South West London TV Ltd as part of
their Adobe Creative Cloud video production workflow.

This demo file contains script examples which use the superb Pymiere library by Quentin Masingarbe (https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere) and are offered under the same GNU license as Pymiere itself.  Feel free to use and
enjoy, and perhaps support the project by sharing your own creations (and
tests, please) by forking Pymiere on Github and creating a Pull Request?

(*) AWSOM stands for "Amazing Ways to Search and Organise Media".  If you're interested in exploring the rest of the AWSOM toolkit, they'll be made
available via a snazzy new web app very soon hopefully - mostly free, but some
on a pay per use basis where we utilise third party services like professional
quality Automatic Speech Recognition.

In the meantime though, please follow us on Twitter and strike up a conversation!
